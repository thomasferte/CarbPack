# CarbPack

This package provides an R wrapper for the Green Algorithms for R
statistical analysis. This package provides an R wrapper for the Green
Algorithms, enabling users to quantify the carbon footprint of their
computations directly within R. The methodology is based on the Green
Algorithms framework, which is thoroughly detailed at Green Algorithms
Calculator (http://calculator.green-algorithms.org/) and in their seminal
publication: Lannelongue, L., Grealey, J., Inouye, M., Green Algorithms:
Quantifying the Carbon Footprint of Computation. Adv. Sci. 2021, 2100707.
