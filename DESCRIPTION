Description: This package provides an R wrapper for the Green Algorithms for R
    statistical analysis. This package provides an R wrapper for the Green
    Algorithms, enabling users to quantify the carbon footprint of their
    computations directly within R. The methodology is based on the Green
    Algorithms framework, which is thoroughly detailed at Green Algorithms
    Calculator (http://calculator.green-algorithms.org/) and in their seminal
    publication: Lannelongue, L., Grealey, J., Inouye, M., Green Algorithms:
    Quantifying the Carbon Footprint of Computation. Adv. Sci. 2021, 2100707.
